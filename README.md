# Cryptography-Project
This program is intended to encrypt simple messages via the use of a password.
Simple prompts are given, and can scramble a message containing only letters from A-Z.
The program was compiled for me with the following UNIX command on Mac OSX
g++ main.cpp Crypter.cpp -o executable
Enjoy!!
